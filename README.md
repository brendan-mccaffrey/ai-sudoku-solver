# Sudoku Solver

## About

This project, written in python, creates instances of 9 x 9 Sudoku boards as ((y,x), [values]) tuples where (y,x) represents a cell and {values} maintains a dict of the respective cell's possible values

## Strategy

The Sudoku class can run three forms of inference solving, with the third strong enough to solve difficult Sudoku puzzles.
